RamanLab Version 1.1.0 - "Batch Peak Fitting Module Enhancement"
Release Date: January 27, 2025

🔄 **Version 1.1.0 Update**

This critical update resolves a Windows-specific database connection issue that
prevented users from accessing the Search/Match functionality, addressing the
"Empty Database" error that occurred despite having valid database files.

🚀 **Key Fixes:**

• Added comprehensive database loading debug information for troubleshooting
• All dependent modules benefit automatically from the improved database connection

🔧 **Technical Details:**
• RamanSpectraQt6 now checks both Documents/RamanLab_Qt6/ and script directory
• Priority order: Documents folder (primary) → Script directory (fallback) → Create new
• Enhanced load_database() method with detailed console debugging output
• Maintains full backward compatibility with existing installations
• Multi-Spectrum Manager and Cluster Analysis benefit automatically via dependency injection
• Polarization Analyzer already used correct script directory path

🐛 **Bug Fixes:**
• Windows users can now access Search/Match functionality without errors
• Database Manager and Search functionality use consistent database sources
• Resolved path separator issues on Windows systems
• Fixed Qt6 QStandardPaths inconsistencies across platforms

🔄 **Previous Release - Version 1.0.3 "Database Manager & Debug Improvements"**

This update introduced database manager functionality and various debugging
