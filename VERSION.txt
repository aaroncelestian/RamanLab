• Added comprehensive database loading debug information for troubleshooting
• All dependent modules benefit automatically from the improved database connection

🔧 **Technical Details:**
• RamanSpectraQt6 now checks both Documents/RamanLab_Qt6/ and script directory
• Priority order: Documents folder (primary) → Script directory (fallback) → Create new
• Enhanced load_database() method with detailed console debugging output
• Maintains full backward compatibility with existing installations
• Multi-Spectrum Manager and Cluster Analysis benefit automatically via dependency injection
• Polarization Analyzer already used correct script directory path

🐛 **Bug Fixes:**
• Windows users can now access Search/Match functionality without errors
• Database Manager and Search functionality use consistent database sources
• Resolved path separator issues on Windows systems
• Fixed Qt6 QStandardPaths inconsistencies across platforms

🔄 **Previous Release - Version 1.0.3 "Database Manager & Debug Improvements"**

This update introduced database manager functionality and various debugging
improvements to enhance the overall user experience and application stability.

🚀 **Key Improvements:**
• Integrated database manager for better data management
• Removed database pulldown menu for cleaner interface
• Database functionality still accessible through Database tab
• Enhanced debugging and error handling throughout application
• Improved code organization and maintenance
• Various bug fixes and stability improvements

🔄 **Previous Release - Version 1.0.2 "DTW Performance Enhancement"**

This update focused on enhancing the DTW (Dynamic Time Warping) algorithm 
performance and overall search user experience with better progress tracking
and informed decision making.

🚀 **Key Improvements:**
• Added DTW performance warning dialog with time estimates
• Enhanced progress tracking for slow algorithms (DTW, Combined)
• Unified Basic and Advanced search architecture
• Real-time progress updates every 10% for better UX
• Early termination optimization when sufficient matches found
• Improved UI responsiveness during long searches

🔄 **Previous Release - Version 1.0.1 "First Update"**

Minor update following the inaugural release with ongoing improvements
and refinements.

🎉 **Previous Release - Version 1.0.0 "Debut"**
