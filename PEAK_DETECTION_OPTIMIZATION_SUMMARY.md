# Peak Detection Optimization Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the optimization improvements made to the batch peak fitting tool's auto peak detection, manual peak addition functionality, and batch processing capabilities.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Auto Peak Detection Problems
**Problem**: When all three sliders were set to zero, only a few peaks were found due to overly restrictive default parameters.

**Solution**: Implemented intelligent adaptive peak detection with even more sensitive defaults:
- **Adaptive Height**: Uses noise-level estimation from the first 10% of spectrum data
- **Adaptive Distance**: Based on spectrum resolution (0.5% of spectrum length)
- **Adaptive Prominence**: Minimum 1% of peak-to-peak range
- **Better Error Handling**: Detailed feedback when no peaks are found

**Original Default Values**:
- Height: 15% of max intensity
- Distance: 20 data points
- Prominence: 20% of peak-to-peak range

**Updated Default Values (Latest)**:
- Height: 2% of max intensity OR 3× noise level (whichever is higher)
- Distance: 5 data points OR 0.5% of spectrum length (whichever is higher)
- Prominence: 5% of peak-to-peak range OR 1% minimum (whichever is higher)

### 2. Manual Peak Addition Not Intuitive
**Problem**: Manual peak addition buttons existed but required separate delete operations. Users wanted to click on peaks to remove them.

**Solution**: Implemented intuitive click-to-toggle peak management:
- **Click to Add**: Click empty areas on spectrum to add peaks
- **Click to Remove**: Click on existing peaks to remove them (within 15 cm⁻¹)
- **Smart Detection**: Distinguishes between adding (5 cm⁻¹ tolerance) and removing (15 cm⁻¹ tolerance)
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of manual mode and instructions
- **Dual Deletion**: Can still use "Delete Last Peak" button for keyboard-only users

### 3. Batch Processing Background Issues
**Problem**: Background subtraction was not automatically applied to each spectrum during batch processing.

**Solution**: Added automatic background processing option:
- **Background Checkbox**: Option to apply background subtraction to all spectra
- **Parameter Reuse**: Uses current ALS parameters (λ and p values)
- **Status Feedback**: Shows which files had background subtraction applied
- **Error Handling**: Continues processing even if background subtraction fails for individual files

## New Features

### Enhanced Manual Peak Management
- **Intuitive Click Behavior**: Click empty areas to add, click peaks to remove
- **Tolerance Zones**: Different click tolerances for adding vs removing peaks
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear instructions and status messages
- **Manual Mode Toggle**: Easy on/off switching with visual indicators

### Improved Batch Processing
- **Automatic Background Subtraction**: Optional background removal for all spectra
- **Parameter Validation**: Validates ALS parameters before batch processing
- **Progress Tracking**: Shows which files have background subtraction applied
- **Result Storage**: Tracks whether background was applied for each spectrum

### Enhanced Visual Feedback
- **Peak Count Display**: Shows number of detected peaks in legend
- **Selected Peak Highlighting**: Orange color with red border for selected peaks
- **Manual Mode Indicator**: Clear indication when in manual mode
- **Better Status Messages**: More informative feedback throughout the process

## Technical Improvements

### Peak Detection Algorithm
```python
# Even more sensitive adaptive height
noise_level = np.std(peak_data[:min(50, len(peak_data)//10)])
height = max(0.02 * np.max(peak_data), 3 * noise_level)  # 2% instead of 5%

# Closer peak detection
distance = max(5.0, len(peak_data) // 200)  # 5 points instead of 10

# Lower prominence threshold
prominence = max(0.05 * np.ptp(peak_data), 0.01 * np.ptp(peak_data))  # 5% and 1% instead of 10% and 2%
```

### Manual Peak Click Logic
```python
# Check for existing peak removal (broader tolerance)
for i, existing_peak in enumerate(self.peak_positions):
    distance = abs(existing_peak - click_wavenumber)
    if distance < 15:  # 15 cm⁻¹ tolerance for removal
        self.peak_positions.pop(i)
        return

# Check for new peak addition (tighter tolerance)
for existing_peak in self.peak_positions:
    if abs(existing_peak - actual_wavenumber) < 5:  # 5 cm⁻¹ tolerance for addition
        return  # Don't add if too close
```

### Batch Background Processing
```python
# Apply background subtraction if enabled
if apply_background and self.current_intensities is not None:
    try:
        self.current_background = self.baseline_als(self.current_intensities, lambda_val, p_val)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Background subtraction failed for {file_path}: {e}")
        self.current_background = None
```

## Usage Instructions

### Auto Peak Detection
1. Load a spectrum file
2. Adjust sliders as needed (0 = auto mode with very sensitive defaults)
3. Click "Find Peaks" or enable "Auto-detect as sliders change"
4. The system will automatically detect many more peaks with default settings

### Manual Peak Addition/Removal
1. Click "Enter Manual Mode" (button turns red)
2. Click empty areas on the spectrum to add peaks
3. Click on existing peaks to remove them
4. Use "Delete Last Peak" for keyboard-only removal
5. Click "Exit Manual Mode" when finished

### Batch Processing
1. Add multiple spectrum files
2. Check "Apply background subtraction to all spectra" if desired
3. Adjust ALS parameters (λ and p) if needed
4. Click "Process All Files"
5. Monitor progress and background subtraction status

## Benefits
- **Much Better Peak Detection**: Finds significantly more peaks with default settings
- **Intuitive Manual Control**: Click-to-add/remove behavior matches user expectations
- **Automated Batch Processing**: Background subtraction applied consistently across all spectra
- **Better Visual Feedback**: Clear indicators for all modes and operations
- **Robust Error Handling**: Continues processing even when individual operations fail
- **Flexible Workflow**: Works well for both automatic and manual peak management

## Performance Improvements
- **Faster Initial Detection**: More peaks found immediately without parameter adjustment
- **Reduced Clicks**: Single click to add or remove peaks
- **Batch Efficiency**: Automatic background processing saves manual steps
- **Better Defaults**: Most users won't need to adjust detection parameters

## Testing
The optimized tool has been tested with:
- **Various Spectrum Types**: Works well across different Raman spectra
- **Mixed Workflows**: Combination of auto detection and manual adjustment
- **Batch Processing**: Multiple files with and without background subtraction
- **Edge Cases**: Noisy spectra, closely spaced peaks, weak signals

Users should now experience:
- **Immediate Results**: Many peaks detected with default settings
- **Intuitive Interface**: Natural click behavior for peak management
- **Consistent Batch Processing**: Reliable background subtraction across all files
- **Better Visual Feedback**: Clear status and progress indicators throughout
