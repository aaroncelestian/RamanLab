## 🎯 Overview

The **Hey-Celestian Classification System** represents a groundbreaking advancement in mineral classification specifically designed for Raman spectroscopy. While traditional classification systems (Hey, Strunz, Dana) organize minerals by chemical composition and crystal structure, the Hey-Celestian system organizes them by their **dominant vibrational signatures** as observed in Raman spectroscopy.

This system builds upon M.H. Hey's foundational work from 1962 but reorganizes minerals according to what Raman spectroscopy actually measures: **vibrational modes**.

## 🔬 Scientific Rationale

### The Problem with Traditional Classifications for Raman

**Traditional Hey System:**
- Groups all silicates together despite vastly different Raman signatures
- Provides no guidance on expected vibrational characteristics
- Offers no predictive analysis capabilities for Raman users

**Example Issue:**
- Quartz (SiO₂): Framework silicate with peaks at 460, 1085 cm⁻¹
- Diopside (CaMgSi₂O₆): Chain silicate with peaks at 665, 1012 cm⁻¹  
- Tourmaline: Ring silicate with peaks at 640, 920 cm⁻¹

All three are classified as "Silicates" in traditional systems, yet they have completely different Raman characteristics requiring different analysis strategies.

### The Hey-Celestian Solution

**Vibrational-Based Organization:**
- **Framework Modes**: Minerals with 3D tetrahedral networks
- **Chain Modes**: Minerals with silicate chains (single/double)
- **Ring Modes**: Minerals with cyclic silicate structures
- **Characteristic Vibrational Modes**: Minerals with discrete molecular units (CO₃²⁻, SO₄²⁻, PO₄³⁻)
- **Layer Modes**: Minerals with layered structures

Each group comes with:
- Expected Raman peak ranges
- Characteristic vibrational modes
- Analysis strategies
- Common interferences
