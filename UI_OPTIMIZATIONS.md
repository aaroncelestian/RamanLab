- **Tab content spacing**: Reduced from 8px to 5px throughout

### CRE Tab Optimizations
- **Basic Parameters**:
  - Shortened "Absolute Threshold" label to "Abs Threshold"
  - Set spin box maximum width to 80px (threshold, ratio)
  - Reduced grid spacing from 6px to 4px

- **Shape Analysis**:
  - Shortened title from "Advanced Shape Analysis" to "Shape Analysis"

- ✅ Maintains full functionality
- ✅ Cleaner, more compact appearance
- ✅ Better use of vertical space in tabbed layout
