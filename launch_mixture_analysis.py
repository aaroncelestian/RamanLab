Launch script for RamanLab Mixture Analysis

UPDATED: Now launches the new Interactive Mixture Analysis by default.
The new interface provides expert-guided, iterative mixture analysis with:
- Interactive peak selection by clicking
- Real-time spectrum overlay and residual analysis  
- Pseudo-Voigt peak fitting
- Database search and component tracking

Old automated analysis has been removed - use interactive version only
