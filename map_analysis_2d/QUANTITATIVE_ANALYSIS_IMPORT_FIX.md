# Quantitative Analysis Import Fix

## Problem Solved

The "Run Quantitative Analysis" button was showing the error:
```
Quantitative analysis modules not found.
Please ensure the analysis modules are properly installed.
```

## Root Cause

The issue was with import paths when running the application from different directories:

1. **Application Structure**: The main application (`main.py`) runs from the parent `RamanLab` directory and imports as `from map_analysis_2d.ui import MapAnalysisMainWindow`

2. **Import Conflicts**: The `integrate_quantitative_analysis.py` file was using relative imports (`from analysis.quantitative_analysis import ...`) which failed when the app was launched from the parent directory

3. **Path Resolution**: The working directory and Python path were different depending on how the app was launched

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Import Logic in `integrate_quantitative_analysis.py`

**Before:**
```python
from analysis.quantitative_analysis import RobustQuantitativeAnalyzer, ComponentResult
```

**After:**
```python
# Handle imports for both running from map_analysis_2d directory and from parent directory
try:
    from analysis.quantitative_analysis import RobustQuantitativeAnalyzer, ComponentResult
except ImportError:
    try:
        from map_analysis_2d.analysis.quantitative_analysis import RobustQuantitativeAnalyzer, ComponentResult
    except ImportError:
        # As a last resort, try absolute import with current directory in path
        current_dir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))
        if current_dir not in sys.path:
            sys.path.insert(0, current_dir)
        from analysis.quantitative_analysis import RobustQuantitativeAnalyzer, ComponentResult
```

### 2. Simplified Import in `ui/main_window.py`

**Before:** Complex path manipulation with verbose error messages

**After:**
```python
# Import with fallback for different directory structures
try:
    from integrate_quantitative_analysis import QuantitativeAnalysisIntegrator
except ImportError:
    from map_analysis_2d.integrate_quantitative_analysis import QuantitativeAnalysisIntegrator
```

## Testing Results

The fix has been tested and verified to work in both scenarios:

✅ **Running from `map_analysis_2d` directory:**
```bash
cd map_analysis_2d
python -c "from integrate_quantitative_analysis import QuantitativeAnalysisIntegrator; print('Success!')"
```

✅ **Running from parent `RamanLab` directory (like the main app):**
```bash
cd RamanLab
python -c "from map_analysis_2d.integrate_quantitative_analysis import QuantitativeAnalysisIntegrator; print('Success!')"
```

## What This Fixes

1. **✅ Run Quantitative Analysis Button**: Now works without import errors
2. **✅ Cross-Directory Compatibility**: Works regardless of launch directory
3. **✅ Robust Import Handling**: Falls back gracefully between import methods
4. **✅ Clean Error Messages**: Simplified error reporting when imports genuinely fail

## How to Verify the Fix

1. **Launch your application** (either from `python main.py` in map_analysis_2d or from the parent directory)
2. **Load your data** and run your analyses (Template, NMF, ML)
3. **Go to the Results tab**
4. **Click "Run Quantitative Analysis"** - it should now work without import errors

If you still get import errors, they would now be due to actual missing dependencies rather than path issues, and the error message will be much clearer about what's missing.

## Files Modified

- `map_analysis_2d/integrate_quantitative_analysis.py`: Added robust import handling
- `map_analysis_2d/ui/main_window.py`: Simplified import with fallback logic

The fix maintains full backward compatibility and doesn't affect any other functionality.
