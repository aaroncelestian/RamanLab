# Pie Chart Legend Fix for Unsupervised ML Results

## Problem
In the unsupervised ML training results (K-Means clustering), the pie chart showing "Cluster Size Distribution" had cluster labels directly on the chart segments, making it cluttered and harder to read.

## Solution
Modified the pie chart to use a clean legend instead of labels on the chart itself.

## Files Changed
- `map_analysis_2d/ui/main_window.py` - Line 2214 in the `_plot_clustering_results` method

## Changes Made

### Before
```python
ax3.pie(counts, labels=labels_for_plot, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=90)
ax3.set_title('Cluster Size Distribution')
```

### After  
```python
# Create pie chart without labels on the chart itself
wedges, texts, autotexts = ax3.pie(counts, autopct='%1.1f%%', startangle=90, colors=colors)
ax3.set_title('Cluster Size Distribution')

# Create legend with cluster labels
ax3.legend(wedges, labels_for_plot, 
          title="Clusters",
          loc="center left", 
          bbox_to_anchor=(1, 0, 0.5, 1))
```

## Key Improvements

✅ **Clean Chart**: Pie chart no longer has labels cluttering the visual  
✅ **Professional Legend**: Cluster labels moved to a neat legend on the right  
✅ **Better Readability**: Easier to see both the chart and identify clusters  
✅ **Preserved Functionality**: Percentage labels still shown on pie slices  
✅ **Consistent Colors**: Legend uses same colors as pie chart segments  

## Visual Result

The pie chart now shows:
- Clean pie slices with only percentage labels
- Professional legend on the right side listing all clusters
- Better use of space and improved readability
- Same color coding between chart and legend for easy identification

## Testing
- ✅ Created test script (`test_pie_chart_legend.py`) to verify the changes
- ✅ Generated before/after comparison images
- ✅ Confirmed all functionality preserved while improving appearance

## Impact
This change affects the **ML Classification** tab in the **unsupervised learning results** when viewing clustering outcomes like K-Means. The chart will now have a cleaner, more professional appearance while maintaining all the same information.

## Usage
No changes needed from user perspective - the improved pie chart will automatically appear when running unsupervised ML analysis in your RamanLab application.
