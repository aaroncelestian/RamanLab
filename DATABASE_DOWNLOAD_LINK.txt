repository. You must download it separately.

Size:     ~200MB
Format:   Python pickle (.pkl)
Contains: 6,939+ experimental Raman spectra


DOWNLOAD LINK

The database is hosted on Zenodo, a trusted research data repository.
This ensures permanent, citable access to the database files.


INSTALLATION
------------

After downloading, place the file in ONE of these locations:

1. Documents/RamanLab_Qt6/RamanLab_Database_20250602.pkl (recommended)
2. Same folder as raman_analysis_app_qt6.py

See DATABASE_INSTALLATION.md for detailed instructions.


VERIFICATION

When RamanLab starts successfully with the database:
✓ Console shows: "Database loaded successfully"

If you don't need the reference database immediately:
